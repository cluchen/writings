I'm Cynthia, a UX Researcher and current graduate student at UC Berkeley. Welcome to my corner of the internet! A goal of mine this year is to be a better writer, and a part of that means publishing from drafts and out into the world.

## Writing

- [The Art of Getting Up to Speed](/n/dx)
- [Reflections on Graduate School a Year In](/n/developer-marketing)




I thrive with documentation, so here's a way for me to list out—and reflect on—all the work I've ever done (whether it's finished or not). This is inspired by Connie Liu's site (https://connie.surf/) that serves as a online abstraction of the self.
